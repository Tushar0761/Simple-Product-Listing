The useEffect()Hook is called
with two arguments with two parameters.
The first argument is a function
that should be executed after every component evaluation
if the specified dependencies changed.
And the specified dependencies
are the second argument that you pass in.
That's an array full of dependencies
and you will see how these dependencies look like
throughout this module.
So an array full of dependencies
and whenever such a dependency changes
that first function will re-run.
And therefore in that first function
you can put any side effect code
and that code will then only execute
when the dependencies specified by you changed
and not when the component re-renders.
So only when your dependencies changed.
